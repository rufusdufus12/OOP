# OOP
Projects made for Object Orientated Programming course during Fall 2016 semester at Coe College.

Projects take input(s) to match riders with rides.
The files "transactions.in" and "transactions.out" are sample input and output files for "hw3.cpp" and "hw3.cpp" only.  These files do not work for other assignments as the input and output requirements of the other assignments are different.

Each project meet the all the requirements of the OOP assignments given.
All input and output are named to match the assignment requirements.
